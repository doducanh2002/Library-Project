## 📈 Sprint Planning Guidelines

### Story Point Estimation Scale
- **1 Point**: 1-2 hours (trivial task)
- **2 Points**: 2-4 hours (simple task)
- **3 Points**: 4-8 hours (moderate task)
- **5 Points**: 1-2 days (complex task)
- **8 Points**: 2-3 days (very complex task)
- **13 Points**: 3+ days (epic task, needs breakdown)

### Definition of Ready (DoR)
- [ ] User story has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Technical dependencies are identified
- [ ] UI/UX mockups available (if needed)
- [ ] Estimated by the team
- [ ] Testable criteria defined

### Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Code is written and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Code quality gates pass
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance requirements met

## 🎯 Sprint Ceremonies

### Sprint Planning (4 hours per sprint)
- Review and refine product backlog
- Select user stories for sprint
- Break down user stories into tasks
- Estimate tasks and commit to sprint goal

### Daily Standup (15 minutes daily)
- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- Are there any blockers?

### Sprint Review (2 hours per sprint)
- Demo completed features
- Gather stakeholder feedback
- Update product backlog based on feedback

### Sprint Retrospective (1.5 hours per sprint)
- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- Action items for next sprint

## 🚨 Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **MinIO Integration Complexity** - Mitigation: Early spike in Sprint 0
2. **Payment Gateway Integration** - Mitigation: Stripe sandbox testing
3. **Performance with Large Datasets** - Mitigation: Early performance testing
4. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Mitigation: Security review in each sprint

### Dependencies
- Database schema must be stable before Sprint 2
- Authentication must be complete before Sprint 3
- Payment integration depends on order management
- Document system depends on MinIO setup

## 📋 Backlog Refinement

### Weekly Refinement Sessions (1 hour)
- Review upcoming user stories
- Add details and acceptance criteria
- Estimate new stories
- Identify dependencies and risks

### Monthly Architecture Review
- Review technical decisions
- Assess performance and scalability
- Plan technical debt reduction
- Update technology choices if needed
